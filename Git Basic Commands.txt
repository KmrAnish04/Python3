1. touch newfile.txt
First, let's look at the command for creating new files, the touch command. You can create an empty file by typing touch file_name and executing it.

2. cat fileName.txt
You can also display the content of a file with the cat command.
To use the cat command, type cat file_name.

3. mkdir directory_name
You can create a new directory using a command as well.
A directory is commonly used interchangeably with the term folder.
To create a directory, use the mkdir command as follows: mkdir directory_name.

4. cd directory_name
You can use the cd command to move to other directories.
By entering cd directory_name, you can move to the specified directory.

5. pwd
On the command line, it is important to know the directory you are currently working in. There is a command called pwd to check that.
When you execute the pwd command as shown below, all directories from the root directory to the current directory are displayed.

6. ls
When moving between directories, it would be convenient if we could see the list of files and directories in the current directory.
To do this, you can use the ls command as shown below.

7. cd ..
We've learned how to use the cd command, but we don't know how to move to the parent directory yet.
If you want to move to the parent directory, you can use a special symbol .., like cd ...

8. cd
If you execute cd without specifying a directory, you can move to what is called a home directory.
The Home directory refers to the base directory for the user.
Since it is important, moving to the home directory is made to be easy.

9. mv file_to_move destination_directory
Let's start with the command to move a file.
To do this, we use the mv command.
By typing mv file_to_move destination_directory, you can move a file to the specified directory.With the mv command, you can also move directories, not just files.
By entering mv directory_to_move destination_directory, you can move all the files and directories under that directory.

10. mv old_file_name new_file_name
The mv command, which we used to move files and directories earlier, can also be used to rename a file.
You can rename a file by typing mv old_file_name new_file_name.

11. mv old_file_name new_file_name
Next, let's look at how to copy files.
To do this, we use the cp command.
You can copy a file by entering cp file_to_copy new_file_name.

12. cp -r directory_to_copy new_directory_name
With the cp command, you can also copy a directory by adding the -r (Recursive copy) option, like cp -r directory_to_copy new_directory_name.
If you try to copy a directory without adding the -r option, you will get an error and the command will not be executed.

13. rm file_to_remove
Next, we'll look at how to remove a file.
To do this, you can use the rm command, like rm file_to_remove.

14. rm -r directory_to_remove
You can also remove a directory by adding the -r option to the rm command, like rm -r directory_to_remove.
Just like the cp command, you will get an error if you forget to add -r.
